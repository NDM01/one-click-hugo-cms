  The goal of our project is to integrate the deaf community into our society.
  We have 
    noticed that there is a great lack of Portuguese sign language content.

We decided to create this project, so that anyone can learn sign language, since all the websites available to learn 
sign language are usually paid. We would like to bring about something new, we created a 
virtual person, Sofia, then analyzed the different solutions and came to the conclusion that 
we could use the software blender for that purpose. 

Our project relies on Sofia to help us, a sign language translator who will teach and demystify prejudices in society.
With this project we intend to help people better understand Portuguese sign language 
and demystify some prejudices in society and we think we can do it. It was a very enjoyable 
project because we both learned programming and sign language.
